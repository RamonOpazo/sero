# Security Overview

SERO is built with security as a foundational principle, implementing multiple layers of protection for your sensitive documents.

## Security Architecture

### Encryption at Rest
- **AES-256**: All stored documents are encrypted
- **Unique Keys**: Each document has its own encryption key
- **Secure Storage**: Keys are managed separately from data
- **No Plaintext**: Documents never stored in plaintext

### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: All communications use latest TLS
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- **HSTS Headers**: Forces secure connections
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Session keys are ephemeral

### File Download Security
- **RSA-2048 Ephemeral Keys**: Generated fresh for each download
- **Password Encryption**: Passwords never sent in URLs
- **Key Destruction**: Private keys destroyed immediately after use
- **No Key Reuse**: Each download uses unique key pair

## Authentication & Authorization

### API Authentication
```
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: Owner, Editor, Viewer, Auditor roles
- **Project Isolation**: Users only access authorized projects
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts logged
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeout and renewal

## Privacy Protection

### Data Minimization
- Only necessary data is collected
- Regular data purging policies
- User data never shared with third parties
- Opt-in for all non-essential features

### Compliance
- **HIPAA Compliant**: Suitable for healthcare data
- **GDPR Compliant**: European data protection standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls audited
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Threat Mitigation

| Threat | Mitigation | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Password exposure in URLs | RSA-encrypted password in POST body | **Eliminated** |
| Man-in-the-middle attacks | TLS 1.3 + Certificate pinning | **Low** |
| Server key compromise | Ephemeral keys with immediate destruction | **Mitigated** |
| Data breaches | Encrypted storage + Access controls | **Low** |
| Replay attacks | Unique key IDs + Time-based expiration | **Mitigated** |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords for each project
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly review and delete unused projects
- Keep browsers updated with security patches
- Report suspicious activities immediately

### For Developers
- Always use HTTPS for API requests
- Validate certificates and implement pinning
- Never cache or log encrypted passwords
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow secure coding practices

## Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues
1. **Email**: security@sero.example.com
2. **PGP Key**: Available for encrypted communications
3. **Response Time**: 24 hours for critical issues
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated responsible disclosure

### Security Updates
- Automatic security patches
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Penetration testing quarterly
- Third-party security audits

## Technical Implementation

### RSA Encryption Process
1. **Key Generation**: Server generates ephemeral RSA-2048 key pair
2. **Public Key Transfer**: Public key sent to client (private key stays on server)
3. **Client Encryption**: Password encrypted with public key using Web Crypto API
4. **Secure Transmission**: Encrypted password sent in POST body
5. **Server Decryption**: Server decrypts password using private key
6. **Key Destruction**: Private key immediately destroyed, no trace remains

### Security Headers
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Auditing & Monitoring

### Security Logs
- Authentication attempts
- File access patterns
- Configuration changes
- API usage patterns
- Error conditions

### Monitoring Alerts
- Unusual access patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Large data downloads
- System performance issues
- Security policy violations
