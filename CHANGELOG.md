  ([`48b84ab`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/48b84ab84fa3fb1916561299f08db7915a44a4f7))


## v0.2.0 (2025-07-26)

### Bug Fixes

- Complete selection system migration with clean architecture
  ([`110f7e9`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/110f7e98bbaa1527d08589cd3aae5ad2b2f17853))

- Create useSelectionLoader hook to load API data directly into new SelectionManager - Update
  DocumentViewer to use clean architecture without mixing old/new systems - Remove bridge pattern
  and establish single source of truth for selection data - New system now handles: API loading →
  state management → UI display - Maintain proper separation of concerns throughout the architecture

This fixes the issue where saved selections weren't visible after Phase 5 migration. The new system
  is now the complete owner of selection data flow.

- Compute frontend is_template from template; include template in documents search join
  ([`bc1b9ee`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/bc1b9eed5e224ad1c005c6241796e29b678c0c5c))

- Configure semantic release with VCS versioning
  ([`35c1ae3`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/35c1ae36cc2b1bd425ec17f140f45ad09d2dfbb2))

- Connect resize functionality to actual selection state
  ([`44b8da1`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/44b8da10a6968c35d847aed66d8dc520d53ea64f))

- Add UPDATE_EXISTING_SELECTION and UPDATE_NEW_SELECTION actions to ViewerState types - Implement
  handlers for both actions in the reducer with bounds checking - Connect SelectionsLayer resize
  logic to dispatch real state updates - Fix visual feedback by updating actual selection data
  during drag - Ensure both existing and new selections update correctly during resize - Add proper
  dependency tracking for useCallback with dispatch

Now when users resize selections, the visual changes are immediately reflected in the underlying
  state, and the sidebar will also show the updated selection coordinates in real-time.

- Correct API endpoints and selection reload flow
  ([`de444da`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/de444da4d397d900f8a8c22eb5e8574b1d832a52))

- Fix selection deletion to use correct /selections/id/{id} endpoint instead of non-existent
  document-scoped endpoint - Fix selection updates to use correct /selections/id/{id} endpoint for
  consistency - Add refetch capability to useDocumentSelections hook for proper state reload -
  Implement proper selection reload after successful save operations - Ensure new selections are
  cleared when reloading fresh selections from backend - Maintain proper state synchronization
  between frontend and backend after saves

The app was failing because frontend was using wrong API endpoints: - DELETE
  /documents/id/{id}/selections/{id} (doesn't exist) → /selections/id/{id} ✓ - PUT
  /documents/id/{id}/selections/{id} (doesn't exist) → /selections/id/{id} ✓ - POST
  /documents/id/{id}/selections (correct) ✓

After saves, selections are now properly reloaded from backend to get real UUIDs and newSelections
  array is cleared since they're now saved.

- Eliminate React-PDF file prop warning by optimizing dependency tracking
  ([`c198c14`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/c198c147e0a620a5e1fcea655e688ea90b45a2f2))

- Add automatic URL redirects for cleaner navigation: * /projects/:projectId ->
  /projects/:projectId/documents * /projects/:projectId/documents/:documentId -> .../original-file

- Fix React-PDF 'File prop changed but equal' warning: * Root cause: RenderLayer useEffect was
  re-running on document object changes * Solution: Track file.id instead of document object
  reference in dependencies * Prevents unnecessary blob/ArrayBuffer recreation for same file content
  * Maintains proper reloading when actual file changes

- Simplify DocumentViewer integration: * Remove complex MemoizedDocumentViewer wrapper * Use key
  prop for proper component lifecycle management * Let React-PDF handle internal optimizations
  naturally

- Improve file loading stability: * Enhanced memoization in RenderLayer using useRef pattern *
  Stable PDF file object references prevent unnecessary reloads * Maintain performance while
  eliminating console warnings

- Fixed an issue between the selection layer and the document layer, in which the selections were
  rendered before the page was rendered, thus producing a race condition that affected the
  calculation of the selections' size.
  ([`6ef21ab`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/6ef21abeee3398b5db0ef8e7cd5cf0e1eaa12808))

- Fixed issue in the document layer in which, upon zooming on a given document, it blew up the its
  container, overflowing and breaking the view.
  ([`eb8d757`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/eb8d757ac11337f1d4eea15a9bb050b17610654d))

- Hide template overlays when viewing the template document itself
  ([`d55777f`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/d55777fe2c563254bd2999a1ddf463ad485f1654))

- Implement consistent 0-based page system across selection layer
  ([`289a33b`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/289a33b60e1c096da9cd6086d4a9a83b91f82181))

- Fix selection navigation bug - clicks now go to correct pages - Standardize page numbering:
  null=global, 0=page1, 1=page2, etc. - Update SelectionsList display logic to add +1 for user
  display only - Fix SelectionsLayer creation to use currentPage directly (0-based) - Update old
  useSelections hook to use 0-based pageIndex - Remove page_number === 0 checks, only use null for
  global selections - Simplify page filtering logic throughout selection rendering - Add utility
  functions for future page/index conversions if needed

Now selection creation, storage, navigation, and display all use consistent 0-based internal
  indexing with +1 only applied for user-facing display. This eliminates the off-by-one navigation
  bugs completely.

- Implement proper flexbox layout for DocumentViewer height
  ([`28b2801`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/28b280141e6c96c24b3da3ac01544c2941a747b9))

- Replace arbitrary calc(100vh-200px) with proper flexbox layout - FileViewer now uses flex-col
  h-full container with flex-1 children - DocumentViewer takes available space naturally from parent
  - All content sections (password prompts, viewer) use flex-1 for proper space distribution - Added
  min-h-0 to prevent overflow issues - Height now adapts properly to any parent container structure
  - Removes dependency on hardcoded viewport calculations

This ensures DocumentViewer properly fills available space regardless of where FileViewer is used in
  the layout hierarchy.

- Implement proper page filtering for selections
  ([`60c18e3`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/60c18e32c679011ed521cd375e5eb549874fcbde))

- Fix page filtering logic to handle page_number field correctly: - page_number = null or 0: Show
  selection on ALL pages - page_number > 0: Show selection only on that specific page - Use actual
  currentPage from viewer state instead of hardcoded value - Convert 0-based currentPage to 1-based
  page_number for comparison - Handle both null and 0 values as 'show on all pages' - Apply
  filtering to existing selections, new selections, and drawing selection

This ensures selections are displayed correctly based on their page assignment and supports both
  document-wide selections (page_number = null/0) and page-specific selections (page_number > 0).

- Preserve selection IDs to enable proper updates instead of duplicates
  ([`890b257`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/890b257067dcbd3ded603fe1953cc04ec4d1ce22))

- Fix SET_EXISTING_SELECTIONS action to preserve SelectionType with id fields - Enhance
  UPDATE_EXISTING_SELECTION to merge updates while preserving metadata - Fix API result handling to
  use .ok/.value instead of .success/.data - Update SelectionsLayer to properly handle selection
  updates and type casting - Resolve TypeScript compilation errors and remove unused imports

This resolves the issue where editing existing selections would create duplicates instead of
  updating the original selections, as the id fields were being stripped during state storage.

- Prevent toast layout shifts by moving Toaster outside grid system
  ([`1e3f457`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/1e3f457bcb1dfa7acaa5a7d83d2b304307a55c7a))

- Move Toaster component outside SidebarProvider grid layout to prevent horizontal space issues in
  document-viewer - Change toast position to top-center for better UX - Toasts now use fixed
  positioning without affecting parent container layouts

- Prevent unnecessary page navigation when clicking selection on current page
  ([`60cc37c`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/60cc37cd9f9791526e69d36b04697d50d46e421d))

When clicking on a selection item in the list that belongs to the current page, avoid calling
  setCurrentPage() unnecessarily as this was causing selections to disappear due to viewport
  refresh.

Now only navigates to a different page if the selection's page differs from the current page,
  maintaining smooth UX when selecting items on the same page.

- Remove old ViewerState system and fix undo/redo conflicts
  ([`0a84904`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/0a84904932ba3878854e94da874781656606312c))

- Delete old ViewerState.tsx, useViewerState.ts, EventHandler.tsx - Replace with minimal
  ViewportState.tsx for viewport concerns only - Update all components to use new ViewportState
  hooks - Remove old SelectionsLayer.tsx (replaced by SelectionsLayerNew) - Fix keyboard shortcut
  conflicts - undo/redo now properly uses SelectionManager - Clean separation: SelectionManager
  handles selections, ViewportState handles viewport - Build successfully passes with no conflicts
  between old and new systems

Resolves undo/redo functionality - now works with proper history granularity

- Resolve 'Unhandled action type: CAPTURE_INITIAL_STATE' warning
  ([`d384dfb`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/d384dfb50b49c4f0996308387f0a4cae2ada92a1))

DOMAIN MANAGER FIX - Action Dispatcher Warning Resolution:

🐛 Issue Fixed: - Console warning: 'Unhandled action type: CAPTURE_INITIAL_STATE' - Occurred when
  domain managers were created without 'changeTracking' behavior - Core manager was dispatching
  CAPTURE_INITIAL_STATE unconditionally

🔧 Root Cause: - Domain manager constructor always dispatched CAPTURE_INITIAL_STATE - loadItems()
  method also dispatched CAPTURE_INITIAL_STATE - But CAPTURE_INITIAL_STATE handler only exists in
  'changeTracking' behavior - Minimal managers with just 'crud' behavior didn't have this handler

✅ Solution Implemented: - Added conditional checks before dispatching CAPTURE_INITIAL_STATE - Only
  dispatch when 'changeTracking' behavior is included in config - Applied fix to both constructor
  (line 75) and loadItems() method (line 189)

🎯 Conditional Logic:

✅ Quality Assurance: - All 45 tests passing (100% success rate) - Console warning completely
  eliminated - No breaking changes to existing functionality - Behavior composition still works
  correctly for all configurations

This fix ensures domain managers only dispatch actions that have registered handlers, maintaining
  clean console output and proper action matching.

- Resolve critical undo/redo issues in selection management
  ([`374803b`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/374803bfd1e96a50380faebf606298acf50d2c7a))

- Fix multiple addToHistory calls in UPDATE_SELECTION and DELETE_SELECTION operations that were
  corrupting the history stack with duplicate entries - Fix initial history state mismatch when
  selections are loaded after manager creation by updating initial snapshot instead of creating
  duplicate entries - Add proper validation and early returns for boundary conditions - Clean up
  excessive debug logging after identifying root causes

The core issues were: 1. History corruption from multiple addToHistory calls per logical operation
  2. Initial history snapshot containing empty state instead of loaded selections 3. This caused
  undo to revert to empty state instead of actual initial state

All undo/redo operations should now work correctly without data loss.

- Resolve infinite re-render loop in document viewer
  ([`6d4b3ab`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/6d4b3ab3ea3ed9b22ef7b0dee8b8d5c35a925bdf))

- Stabilize registerPage and other action functions using useCallback - Fix Controller component to
  use unified viewer state instead of old context - Add SET_VIEWING_PROCESSED action to ViewerState
  reducer - Prevent infinite loop caused by function recreation on every render

This resolves the 'Maximum update depth exceeded' error and restores functionality to the refactored
  document viewer.

- Resolve major TypeScript compilation errors
  ([`9c99a60`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/9c99a600b7bde67c95298dd09eab47485460279a))

- Fix setShowSelections to use toggleSelections in ActionsLayer - Remove InfoLayer export conflict
  from index.ts - Fix duplicate type exports by being more specific with coordinate system exports -
  Update DocumentsDataTable and ProjectsDataTable copy actions to remove callback parameter - Clean
  up unused imports and variables: - Remove unused React import from InfoLayer - Remove unused
  fileWithBlob variable from InfoLayer - Clean up SelectionsLayer props and unused imports - Remove
  unused imports from AppSidebar and NavMain - Fix breadcrumbs unused index parameter

Reduced TypeScript errors from 44 to ~20, with remaining errors being mostly unused variables that
  don't affect functionality. Core document viewer on-demand loading feature is fully functional.

- Resolve redo shortcut conflicts with browser-reserved Ctrl+Shift+Z
  ([`f3ade47`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/f3ade47592d03f2f752c8244af43c614b8429fb5))

## Problem Ctrl+Shift+Z doesn't work in most browsers because it's reserved for: - Chrome/Edge:
  'Reopen closed tab' - Firefox: Tab management - System-level shortcuts on Linux/Windows

The keydown event never reaches JavaScript when browser intercepts it.

## Solution - **Primary redo shortcut**: Ctrl+Y (standard, reliable across all browsers) -
  **Fallback redo shortcut**: Ctrl+Shift+Z (works where not reserved) - **Undo shortcut**: Ctrl+Z
  (unchanged, works everywhere)

## Technical Details - Browser event interception happens before preventDefault() - System-level
  shortcuts take precedence over web apps - Ctrl+Y is the most reliable redo shortcut for web
  applications

Both undo and redo now work perfectly with proper keyboard shortcuts

- Resolve TypeScript build errors after refactoring
  ([`597a59a`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/597a59af9271398d41be5018667e09a1add24a05))

- Remove unused document parameter from DocumentViewControls component - Remove unused
  MinimalDocumentType import - Update component usage to match new signature - Build now passes
  successfully with clean architecture

- Resolve TypeScript build errors in PromptManager implementation
  ([`81b1e95`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/81b1e95096fa9fd94e2487e915d75cb9ca70a46c))

- Fix Result type usage: use 'ok' property instead of 'success' and 'value' instead of 'data' -
  Remove unused imports and variables across all components - Clean up AddPromptDialog interface to
  remove unused documentId parameter - Ensure all Result type patterns match the axios wrapper
  implementation - Build now passes successfully with no TypeScript errors

- Update component property access for new domain manager system
  ([`0c8e8d9`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/0c8e8d920db194ec65a185d51b7ed20740d1ad66))

- Fixed PromptsList.tsx to use initialState.savedItems instead of savedPrompts - Fixed
  SelectionCommander.tsx to use savedItems instead of savedSelections - Fixed SelectionsList.tsx to
  use savedItems/newItems instead of savedSelections/newSelections - Added null safety with optional
  chaining and fallback arrays - Resolved 'Cannot read properties of undefined' errors in all
  components - All components now compatible with reorganized domain manager architecture

- Update index.ts exports after component reorganization
  ([`b731220`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/b7312200b8bf08d4f065d9ba2bed7e241b9699b3))

- Export new layout components (MainLayout, ViewportLayout, TooldeckLayout) - Export viewport
  components from new viewport directory - Update core system exports for clean architecture -
  Maintain all public API exports for components

- **actions-layer**: Narrow MenuNode to MenuItem when rendering config items to satisfy TS; support
  nested submenus
  ([`afbe828`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/afbe828336a9264f2ffaa26078b3e1e06bb4e97c))

- **api**: Adjust prompts delete-all route to /by-document/id/{document_id} and update frontend
  consumer
  ([`cacd0a7`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/cacd0a728588496fa4e1f26bf75eb07880cd7bca))

- **ci**: Disable semantic-release build command
  ([`1e71ab9`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/1e71ab9688e32713da0b18424279a6134b7ff58a))

The 'uv' command was not found in the semantic-release action's environment, causing the release
  workflow to fail. This change disables the build step within semantic-release, as the build is
  already handled by a separate step in the 'release.yml' workflow.

- **docs**: Serve home doc (path './') at /docs and slug; coerce frontmatter date to string; load
  markdown from public
  ([`f0289ea`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/f0289ea3332f892bb928af6ada685213f5acaf08))

- **document-viewer**: Stabilize selection reload effect; use live document in redacted toggle to
  avoid stale state and allow repeated toggling
  ([`d50cd98`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/d50cd982797a3a0033037ad69854d01a51cb4dc7))

- **document-viewer/selections**: Stabilize undo/redo navigation and rendering
  ([`105aa32`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/105aa32340e89d6340b6a89a5c4e2f0a9778d9be))

- navigate only when destination page differs to avoid unnecessary rerenders - compute target page
  from manager history; apply state first, then navigate on next frame - ensure selections redisplay
  reliably after redo without manual redraw

- **download**: Use document ID as redacted filename to prevent name leakage; scrub PDF metadata
  ([`168e090`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/168e090164781dbe8e9cdd0dfc3224b17ebba938))

  existence and use existing CRUD methods - Enables on-demand loading of prompts/selections instead
  of including in DocumentType - Prepares for FileViewer optimization to eliminate unnecessary
  DocumentType fields

- Add manual verification test runner for domain managers
  ([`8401c9e`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/8401c9ecb1366e161d80b38cf7d3cff6f866b22a))

This commit introduces a complete overhaul of the frontend application layout, replacing the static
  layout with a modern, responsive, and collapsible sidebar navigation system.

Key changes include: - A new `Sidebar` component, which is collapsible, responsive for mobile, and
  configurable. - A completely redesigned main `Layout` that integrates the new sidebar. - New UI
  components such as `Widget`, `Avatar`, `Tooltip`, and `Collapsible` to build a more consistent and
  polished interface. - Refactored application routing (`App.tsx`) to be more semantic and RESTful
  (e.g., `/projects/:id/documents`). - An improved `Breadcrumbs` component that dynamically
  generates paths based on the new routing structure. - A new `HomeView` to serve as the
  application's landing page. - Enhancements to the `DataTable` component for better alignment and a
  cleaner look.

### Performance Improvements

- Eliminate resize drag lag by disabling transitions during resize
  ([`e9bce02`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/e9bce028560c0fe696305cc942cf19c909316afe))

- Conditionally disable CSS transitions during active resize operations - Only the selection being
  resized has transitions disabled (others keep smooth animations) - Add RAF cleanup for proper
  memory management on unmount - Prevent animation conflicts that cause visual lag during drag
  operations

The resize experience is now buttery smooth without the delay/lag that was caused by CSS transitions
  fighting with the real-time coordinate updates during mouse movement.

### Refactoring

- Add API methods to SelectionManager and update SelectionCommander
  ([`a34091b`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/a34091b5946696403475c6e060be3dfada34206a))

- Update SelectionProvider to accept documentId prop and pass to SelectionManager - Update
  DocumentViewer to pass document.id to SelectionProvider - Expose saveAllChanges method through
  SelectionProvider context - Refactor SelectionCommander to use SelectionManager.saveAllChanges
  instead of direct API calls - Remove unused imports and variables - Maintain consistent
  architecture pattern with PromptManager - All builds pass successfully

- Added optional ids for selection and prompt creation, and reflected changes on the frontend side.

  definitions from old viewer system - Remove unused imports and variables (Badge,
  selectedSelection, hasUnsavedChanges, etc.) - Remove redundant pageToArrayIndex function that just
  returned same value - Fix TypeScript build errors and achieve clean build - Unify all selection
  operations through new change management system - Maintain unified save flow with creates,
  updates, and deletes via pendingChanges API

- Complete component and architecture reorganization
  ([`092fee3`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/092fee31740e3c001ab1f9a1bc7979c167b05031))

MAJOR REFACTORING - Document Viewer Module Restructuring:

🏗️ Architecture Reorganization: - Restructured document-viewer into clean, logical directory
  structure - Created providers/, components/, utils/, hooks/, types/ organization - Moved all files
  using IDE refactoring to preserve import references - Eliminated empty legacy directories (core/,
  dialogs/, layouts/, etc.)

📦 Module Entry Point Consolidation: - Consolidated document-viewer.tsx + index.ts into single
  index.tsx - Implemented standard React pattern: directory imports resolve to index.tsx - Both
  default and named exports available for flexibility - Cleaner import paths: import DocumentViewer
  from '@/components/features/document-viewer'

🔧 State Management Consolidation: - Removed redundant useDocumentViewerState.ts hook - Enhanced
  ViewportProvider with all missing functionality - Eliminated unnecessary wrapper components
  (ViewerWithNewSystem, ViewerWithCleanArchitecture) - Single clean DocumentViewer entry point with
  proper provider nesting

🛠️ Import Path Updates: - Fixed import paths throughout codebase for new structure - Updated manager
  configs to use new types location - Fixed editor-view.tsx import to use new index.tsx location -
  All components now use clean, predictable import patterns

📋 Documentation Updates: - Added comprehensive index.tsx consolidation directive to
  DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md - Applies to ALL component modules encapsulated behind directories -
  Updated architecture diagram to reflect new document-viewer structure - Clear guidelines for
  standard React ecosystem patterns

✅ Quality Assurance: - All 45 tests passing (100% success rate) - No breaking changes to
  functionality - Full type safety preserved throughout refactoring - Production-ready with improved
  maintainability

This establishes the new standard pattern for all complex component modules: use index.tsx as
  consolidated entry point for components with sub-structure.

- Complete overhaul of the document-viewer component for propper PDF rendering and selection layer.
  ([`0b8e147`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/0b8e147d23aa7779bf2aa41bd4e05091a868edfd))

- Create clean API layer architecture and eliminate redundant useProjects hook
  ([`20741ef`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/20741ef0995be45b0f3ac2a8476c795b05aedd82))

🎯 ARCHITECTURAL EXCELLENCE: Perfect separation of concerns achieved

Key Improvements: ✅ Created ProjectsAPI utility layer for centralized project CRUD operations ✅
  Refactored useProjectsView to directly use ProjectsAPI (no hook-to-hook coupling) ✅ Removed
  redundant useProjects hook (consolidation of responsibilities) ✅ Simplified WorkspaceProvider to
  only handle selection state (not CRUD) ✅ Renamed use-projects-view.ts to follow dashed-case naming
  convention

Clean Architecture Layers: 📊 ProjectsAPI (src/lib/projects-api.ts) → Pure data operations + error
  handling 🎛️ useProjectsView → Component business logic + UI state + dialog management 🖥️
  ProjectsDataTable → Pure UI presentation layer 🗂️ WorkspaceProvider → Global selection state only
  (no CRUD)

Benefits: • Better separation of concerns (data ↔ business logic ↔ UI) • No redundant state
  management (eliminated useProjects duplication) • Cleaner dependencies (API utilities → hooks →
  components) • Future-proof API layer (easy to externalize or mock for testing) • Proper
  encapsulation (ProjectsView owns its operations)

Build Status: ✅ Passing with zero errors Architecture: ✅ Fully compliant with DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md
  directives

- Improve workspace vs project semantic naming in WorkspaceProvider
  ([`129df4c`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/129df4c627b6c122908115d1e4c6bfd43ef05040))

✅ SEMANTIC CLARITY: Better distinction between workspace-level and project-level concerns

Key Improvements: - Updated localStorage key: 'sero-refactor-state' → 'sero-workspace-state' -
  Renamed persistence functions to be workspace-specific: • saveStateToStorage →
  saveWorkspaceToStorage • loadStateFromStorage → loadWorkspaceFromStorage • clearStoredState →
  clearWorkspaceStorage - Renamed persistence interfaces: PersistedState → PersistedWorkspaceState -
  Enhanced comments to distinguish workspace vs project actions - Updated function comments and
  variable names for semantic clarity

Semantic Distinction: - 'Workspace': App-wide state management (persistence, initialization,
  cross-component state) - 'Project': Individual project entities and CRUD operations - This creates
  clear mental model: workspace contains projects, not the other way around

Build Status: ✅ Passing Consistency: ✅ All naming semantically aligned with purpose

- Major API simplification and Tag model removal
  ([`9395feb`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/9395febad4f32c825c83bdbd1d40a96b04524aa2))

- Refactored frontend import/exports.
  ([`9763d29`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/9763d29204bd5ffb5c265b1c58f3b7e56422ea7c))

- Remove 'Refactor' prefix from all components and clean up naming
  ([`973e0d8`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/973e0d883e344879d3404e64363b02038c8db1f4))

- Rename RefactorApp.tsx → App.tsx - Rename RefactorProjectProvider.tsx → ProjectProvider.tsx -
  Rename useRefactor* hooks → use* hooks (useProjects, useDocuments, useFiles) - Rename Refactor*
  components → clean component names - Update all imports and references throughout the codebase -
  Remove old unused files (FilesView, etc.) - Clean up component exports in views/index.ts

This removes the temporary 'Refactor' prefixes that were used during development and establishes

The editor-view now properly handles its own file management while document-viewer components have
  their data fetching hooks co-located. Workspace-provider is simplified to focus only on
  cross-component state.

- Remove Project.version across backend and tests; migrate Pydantic configs to ConfigDict; fix tests
  and event loop shutdown; deflake BaseCrud filters
  ([`04c2dd3`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/04c2dd3a0797156a5824e54ae8e02a4348adf417))

- Remove unused global hooks and create document-viewer API
  ([`09ccb5a`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/09ccb5ac15b387bc9dda2aad07d6f863dc1fedb7))

- Remove obsolete usePrompts.ts and useSelections.ts from global hooks - These were not being used
  (document-viewer has its own providers) - Create document-viewer-api.ts with centralized API
  functions: - Prompt operations: fetch, create, update, delete - Selection operations: fetch,
  create, update, delete - Update DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md to reflect changes - Update hooks/index.ts
  to remove unused exports

Next step: Refactor document-viewer components to use the new API for proper separation of concerns
  (API logic -> lib/, UI logic -> components/)

- Rename ProjectProvider to WorkspaceProvider with dashed-case naming
  ([`1c8ac82`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/1c8ac826a2fcb0212ee093f846550a9852e8493d))

✅ ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENT: Better semantic naming for app-wide state manager

Key Changes: - Renamed ProjectProvider.tsx → workspace-provider.tsx (dashed-case file naming) -
  Updated ProjectProvider → WorkspaceProvider (more accurate scope) - Updated useProject →
  useWorkspace (clearer purpose) - Renamed internal types: ProjectState → WorkspaceState,
  ProjectAction → WorkspaceAction - Updated all imports across codebase to use new naming - Added
  mandatory dashed-case file naming directive to DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md

Rationale: - WorkspaceProvider manages projects, documents, AND files (not just projects) -
  Dashed-case files provide visual distinction from PascalCase functions/components - useWorkspace
  is clearer than useProject for accessing app-wide workspace state - Eliminates naming confusion -
  'Project' now specifically refers to project entities

Build Status: ✅ Passing Architecture: ✅ Fully compliant with DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md directives

- Rename types and resolve map errors
  ([`562f50f`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/562f50fdbc52a0fa4bf8052e347c9c98b6415d55))

- Reorganize view components into dedicated views/ directory
  ([`644f982`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/644f98271a44ed9f45571f7dabc42a8d4c8247df))

- Move projects-view, documents-view, and editor-view from components/ to views/ - Update all import
  paths to use new @/views/* structure - Create views/index.ts for clean public API exports - Update
  DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md to reflect new architecture: - Views now properly separated from reusable
  components - Updated import examples and domain boundaries - Clarified view vs component
  responsibilities - Maintain all existing functionality with improved organization

This establishes a clearer separation between: - views/: Application-specific view components with
  business logic - components/: Reusable UI components and shared functionality - features/: Complex
  self-contained features like document-viewer

- Replace complex tab system with unified DocumentViewer
  ([`062d84a`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/062d84a9fb24de55621941f4e4aee49928f5653e))

- Remove unnecessary Preview/Prompts/Selections/Info tabs in FileViewer - Use DocumentViewer's
  built-in ORIGINAL/REDACTED toggle functionality - Simplify FileViewer to show single
  DocumentViewer instance - All viewer functions (selections, prompts, info) accessible via right
  sidebar - Clean up unused imports and state variables - Maintain existing password handling and
  file loading logic

This leverages the existing toggle button in the Controls component for switching between original
  and redacted documents, providing a cleaner UX while preserving all functionality.

- Simplify CSS Grid sidebar layout
  ([`8dd834d`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/8dd834d3f12d1a66c35eb576ae579b484b3860d2))

- Remove redundant width calculations - let grid handle sizing - Eliminate verbose comments and
  section dividers - Trust CSS Grid variables for automatic column sizing - Reduce file size by ~60%
  while maintaining functionality - Clean, minimal comments focused on essential context

- Standardize component structure with dashed-case naming and clean architecture
  ([`d2cf5bd`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/d2cf5bdb74f24292143a878f8a6d96308ce90fea))

- Rename all component directories to dashed-case (documents-view, projects-view, layout) - Rename
  all component files to dashed-case for consistency - Refactor documents management to follow clean
  architecture pattern: * Extract DocumentsAPI utility for centralized API operations * Consolidate
  useDocuments functionality into useDocumentsView * Remove document CRUD operations from
  WorkspaceProvider (keep only selection state) * Update documents to use bulk upload instead of
  individual creation - Apply same architectural patterns as projects management for consistency -
  Update all imports and exports to use new dashed-case paths - Maintain component name conventions
  (PascalCase for React components) - Ensure TypeScript type safety and build integrity

This creates a consistent, maintainable codebase with proper separation of concerns where workspace
  manages selection state and components manage their own CRUD operations.

- Standardize theme context to follow provider pattern
  ([`637d773`](https://github.com/RamonOpazo/sero/commit/637d773b8e79becb11367aeeeed4b746749cb6d9))

- Rename ThemeContext.tsx to theme-provider.tsx for dashed-case consistency - Restructure theme
  context to match workspace-provider pattern: * Separate ThemeState interface for state structure *
  ThemeContextType interface for provider contract * Proper memoization with useMemo and useCallback
  * Consistent error handling and context validation - Update ThemeToggle component to use new
  useTheme hook interface - Maintain all existing functionality while improving code consistency -
  Follow same architectural patterns as other context providers

This creates consistent provider patterns across all context implementations.

This commit introduces a significant architectural refactoring of both the backend and frontend to
  improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and enhance performance.

### Backend

- **Generic CRUD Layer:** Introduced a `CRUDBase` class that abstracts common database operations
  (create, read, update, delete). All existing CRUD modules for projects, documents, files, etc.,
  have been refactored to inherit from this base class. This drastically reduces boilerplate and
  standardizes data access patterns.

- **API & Schema Simplification:** The API routers and Pydantic schemas have been updated to align
  with the new generic CRUD layer, resulting in cleaner and more consistent endpoint
  implementations.

### Frontend

- **New DataTable Component:** The existing `DataTable.old.tsx` has been replaced with a completely
  new, more powerful, and reusable `DataTable` component. The new implementation is decoupled into
  smaller, more manageable sub-components for content, pagination, and toolbar actions.

- **Type-Safe & Generic:** The new DataTable is fully generic and type-safe, allowing it to be
  easily adapted for displaying different types of data (e.g., Projects, Documents, Files) with
  minimal effort.

- **Improved UI/UX:** The views for Projects, Documents, and Files have been updated to use the new
  DataTable, providing a more consistent and responsive user experience.

This holistic refactoring establishes a more robust and scalable foundation for future development.

- **crud**: Align files crud with DB; add tags stub; enrich shallow/summary; minor schema defaults
